# QExPy

## Introduction

QExPy (Queenâ€™s Experimental Physics) is a python 3 package designed to facilitate data analysis in undergraduate physics laboratories. The package contains a module to easily propagate errors in uncertainty calculations, and a module that provides an intuitive interface to plot and fit data. The package is designed to be efficient, correct, and to allow for a pedagogic introduction to error analysis. The package is extensively tested in the Jupyter Notebook environment to allow high quality reports to be generated directly from a browser.

## Getting Started

To install the package, type the following command in your terminal or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) shell.
